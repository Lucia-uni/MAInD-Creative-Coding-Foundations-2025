# Assigment 01

## Brief

Starting from the concept of a pinboard, implement a web page that:

- is responsive (properly layout for smartphone, tablet, and desktop)
- allows the user to add and remove elements
- allows the user to coustomize elements (i.e. colors, size)
- allows the switch between two views (at least)
